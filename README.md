# Initial plan
Creating an algorithm that has no applied logic, but instead learns from its previous attempts and improves.
The best environment for that seemed to be Tic Tac Toe as the rules are plain, evaluation is easy and it is possible to supervise the process.

# Logic types
- Supervised Machine Learning - simply: if last time I won I should do the same if not I shouldn't do this...
- Neural Networks - a group of 'neurons' trained on the dataset obtained form the attempts from SML
- Rule-based Ai - all the decisions are based on a given set of rules (only used in game)

# How it works:

- Supervised Machine Learning
